Memory training application for those who do BLD competitively.

The final program is expected to force certain states of the cube, as well as simulate certain memo 'paces' under your lettering scheme.
For example, if you're particularly slow at commutator X, my program will generate scrambles that contain commutator X on demand.

Started coding this on a whim.
Program is severely incomplete as of now. Expect tons of improvement in the upcoming days, though.

Currently can test/generate scrambles with parity, twisted corners, and flipped edges.

You may noticed I hard-encoded my own lettering scheme for now.
This was just to simplify coding on my part, this is easily changeable later.
In the meantime, obfuscation working as intended.
