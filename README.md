mem
===

Memory training application for those who do BLD competitively. 
Written in Java by Angel Lim.

Started coding this on a whim.
Program is severely incomplete as of now. Expect tons of improvement in the upcoming days, though.

Currently can test/generate scrambles with parity, twisted corners, and flipped edges.

You may noticed I hard-encoded my own lettering scheme for now.
This was just to simplify coding on my part, this is easily changeable later.
In the meantime, obfuscation working as intended.
