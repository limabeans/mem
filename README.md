Commutator and memory training application for those who do 3BLD competitively. 

Written in Java by Angel Lim.

3BLD = solving the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube blindfolded.

Currently, the program can generate scrambles with any combination of parity, flipped edges, and twisted corners, along with the choice of one forced edge or corner commutator.

Future features include:
-generating scrambles of a certain metric (i.e. 13/7)
-an implemented "Solve Stats" section
-more sophisticated text exporting
-memory training
-a txt config file
-the first timer with a built in Facebook chat?!
-the first timer with a built in music playlist builder?!


You may noticed I hard-encoded my own lettering scheme for now.
This was just to simplify coding on my part, this is easily changeable later.
In the meantime, obfuscation working as intended.
